Plenty of one-liners, polite to sharks.","4","Suffered by being one of three (feminism win), cool colour coordinated costumes ","4","eh, not really. Points for the small army of frogmen","9","Honestly pretty good, a coherent plan, a reasonably amount of ruthlessness, henchmen, lairs all that jazz","7","Bonus points for submarine shenangians","7","Lots of glamour of the bahamas","9","good set design, extravagant underwater sections, ","4","It started out so well with a coherent plan and engagin villainy, but the reality is the second act drags on quite a bit","7","lot of questionable consent and animal shenanigans","1","aside from bond socking the woman, not much.

He got nothing on the kween Shirley Bassey.","7","A bit plastic. However, he didn’t hesitate to sacrifice a woman for his own needs.","3","Had only three facial expressions, two of which were ‘honery for connery’","8","Good gadgets. The British were just about colonially supremacist.","9","Excellent removal of incompetent henchman. Ludicrously large ransom demand. Wonderfully disposable henchmen. Needed more puns.","7","Generally. Needed more laser sharks.","10","Can’t beat a good Caribbean movie set.","8","The increased budget really showed. However the cars are not nearly convincing enough","7","Standard ransom/save the day plot. Merely a device for the gratuitous seduction and masculine aura.","8","Not enough yellowface. Was expecting more dispensable minorities. Depictions of the French were magnifique.","9","Sean Connery should be sentenced to twenty bonks of the horny bat.","9","Russian accent wasn’t bad","6","Standard fare"
