""Positively Shocking"".","9","Faultless. Distinctive, but links back to the OG bond theme on occasion. Plus Bassey.","8","Brings back the indecency from Dr No, and Bond is much more proactive than in Russia with love. Actually does stuff, even when he's captured","8","Actually had some agency in the film, and had multiple bond girls.","6","In the end Leiter helps out, but abandons bond after seeing he's gonna bang. Pussy actually essential to the plot.","9","Goldfinger was decent, quite memey, takes out the american mafia at will. But Oddjob does the heavy lifting. One of the greatest villains.","6","Tracker ends up being useless, and the car lets him down. Although it does have the DB5 so marks there","4","Golf clubs and Baltimore? Allow Miami fam.","7","Custom gold clothes very amusing, car chase in the compound is pretty good, as is the fight scene in fort knox","9","Makes sense (for a bond film), although why GoldFinger keeps bond alive I have no idea.","9","Best ass slap so far. Rough and tumble with the ladies. Bond at his finest. No overt racism though","9","Bond's interaction with women and Oddjob are king, and Leiter forgoing US National Security to not cockblock Bond is highly amusing.","","","9","One of the best."
